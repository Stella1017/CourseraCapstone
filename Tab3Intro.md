This capstone project is the final project of Coursera Specialization "Data Science."
The overall goal for this project is to build a predictive language model, based on the training data  ( [data.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip) ) provided by the course (thanks to the partnership with SwiftKey).
This project includes two parts:

1. A Shiny application
2. A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter

You can find the deck here:
