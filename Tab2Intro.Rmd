### Multiple Choices Question

This Shiny application can help you to find answers to quizzes for the Capstone course.  

* First, type in the sentence that you need to complete (or the last two words of the sentence)  
* Second, type in all the four choices  
  
It will provide you its best guess. However, due to the limited size of its "dictionary", the accuracy may not be very high.
