### Predictive Keyboard

This Shiny application will work as a predictive keyboard. It will provide you up to 4 words to select from based on the previous words you typed in. So far it only support English.

There are two ways to input:  

* Directly type your sentence in the text box  
* Click the buttons to select a next word  

(It may take a few seconds to load the data when you use it for the first time)
